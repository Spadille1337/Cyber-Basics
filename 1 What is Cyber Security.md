And the term

**Cyber Security (aka Information Technology Security)** refers to the techniquess or practice of protecting computers, networks, programs and data from unauthorised access or attacks that are aimed for `exploitation`.

_Exploitation is the act of selfishly taking advantage of someone or a group of people in order to profit from them or otherwise benefit oneself._

The main aim of Cyber Security is to reduce the risk of cyber attacksÂ and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies.

There are two large areas within Cyber Security:
- Offensive Security
- Defensive Security

**Offensive Security**
This area involves attacking different applications and technologies to discover vulnerabilities.

**Defensive Security**
While Offensive Security involves actively finding vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within technologies, Defensive Security involves detecting and stopping these attacks.
